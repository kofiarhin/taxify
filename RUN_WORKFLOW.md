# Run Workflow

This is the master orchestration prompt for a reusable AI engineering workflow. It turns either the latest direct user prompt or `WORK_REQUEST.md` into clarified, specified, planned, verified engineering work.

## Command To Agent

Use the latest direct user prompt as the primary request source when it looks like project work. Sync it into `WORK_REQUEST.md`, then execute this workflow exactly.

Before touching code, ask focused clarifying questions until you reach about 90% understanding. If the user explicitly says `skip questions`, generate a best-effort spec and record assumptions.

Default execution mode is `complete-workflow`. Do not stop after `TASK-001` unless the user explicitly selected `single-task` or a stop condition is reached.

Execution modes:

- `plan-only`: ask questions, write spec, write task plan, then stop.
- `single-task`: execute only the next ready task, verify and review it, update artifacts, then stop.
- `complete-workflow`: execute all generated tasks sequentially until the request/spec is complete or a stop condition is reached.

Do not implement without:

1. A saved spec in `_spec/`.
2. A saved vertical task plan in `_task/`.
3. A current read of `_handoff/current.md`.
4. A current read of `_progress/progress.md`.
5. A current read of the latest relevant `_summary/` entry.
6. Task status transitions that follow `Planned -> Ready -> In Progress -> Verified -> Reviewed -> Done`.

## Pipeline

```txt
direct user prompt or WORK_REQUEST
-> sync WORK_REQUEST
-> questions
-> spec in _spec
-> read _progress and _summary
-> read or create _handoff/current.md
-> vertical plan in _task
-> execute every task in order by default
-> verify each task
-> critique/fix and review each task
-> update _progress after each task
-> update _handoff/current.md after each task
-> final diff audit
-> review in _review
-> release notes in _release
-> final summary in _summary
-> update _handoff/current.md
-> health check
```

## 1. Resolve Active Request

Read:

- Latest user prompt in the current conversation.
- `WORK_REQUEST.md`.
- `AGENTS.md`.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- `_handoff/current.md`, creating it if missing.
- `_progress/progress.md`, creating it if missing.
- The latest relevant file in `_summary/`, if any.

If `_handoff/`, `_spec/`, `_task/`, `_progress/`, `_review/`, `_summary/`, `_release/`, or `_decisions/` is missing, create it before continuing. If `_handoff/current.md` is missing, create it from the handoff template. If `_progress/progress.md` is missing, create it with an initial heading.

Request source rules:

- If the latest user prompt looks like project work, it is the active request.
- Project work includes prompts like `generate mern boilerplate`, `implement login feature`, `fix dashboard bug`, `audit security`, or `refactor auth`.
- If there is no direct project-work prompt, use the request stored in `WORK_REQUEST.md`.
- Do not require the user to manually edit workflow docs before proceeding.

Sync the active request into `WORK_REQUEST.md` before questioning and planning. Preserve useful optional context when present, but make the latest active request obvious.

Before planning, read `_handoff/current.md` if it exists. If no handoff exists, create it and populate the current request, request ID, current phase, known artifact paths, blockers, verification status, workflow health status, suggested next prompt, and continuation notes.

## 1A. Continue Workflow Command

If the active user prompt is exactly or primarily `continue workflow`, resume instead of restarting intake:

1. Read `_handoff/current.md` first and use it as the primary resume source.
2. If no handoff exists, create it, then fall back to `_progress/progress.md`, the latest relevant `_summary/`, the latest `_task/`, and the referenced spec to reconstruct the live state.
3. Read `_progress/progress.md` to verify completed task history.
4. If `_handoff/current.md` conflicts with `_progress/progress.md`, trust `_progress/progress.md` for completed task history and update handoff accordingly.
5. Read the latest relevant file in `_summary/`, if any.
6. Read the task plan referenced by `_handoff/current.md`, or the latest file in `_task/` if handoff has no task plan.
7. Read the spec referenced by that task plan.
8. Find the next task whose status is not `Done`.
9. Continue from that task.
10. Do not ask the original intake questions again unless a current ambiguity blocks safe continuation.
11. Do not regenerate the entire spec unless the request changed.
12. Continue executing remaining tasks sequentially until all tasks are complete or a stop condition is reached.
13. If all tasks are `Done`, complete any missing `_review/`, `_summary/`, handoff update, workflow health check, or final response step.

## 2. Intake And Questioning

Do not touch code in this phase.

Ask focused clarifying questions until there is about 90% understanding of the request. Ask fewer questions for tiny, obvious requests. Group questions so the user can answer efficiently.

Clarify:

- Goal.
- Users.
- Exact behavior.
- Edge cases.
- UI expectations.
- API expectations.
- Data model expectations.
- Constraints.
- Success criteria.
- What is out of scope.

If the prompt explicitly says `skip questions`:

- Do not ask questions.
- Generate the best possible spec from available context.
- Record assumptions and open questions in the spec.

Stop questioning when:

- The user has answered enough to proceed.
- The remaining unknowns are minor and can be documented as assumptions.
- The user explicitly says to proceed.

## 3. Classify Request

Classify the request as one primary type:

- `feature`: Adds user-facing or system behavior.
- `bugfix`: Fixes broken behavior.
- `boilerplate`: Creates project structure or starter configuration.
- `security`: Audits or improves security.
- `refactor`: Improves structure without intentional behavior change.
- `test`: Adds or repairs tests.
- `docs`: Updates documentation only.
- `ops`: Changes deployment, CI, environment, or infrastructure.
- `research`: Investigates and reports without implementation.

Also identify:

- Scope: `small`, `medium`, or `large`.
- Risk: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- Whether implementation is allowed after spec and plan.
- Whether any open question blocks implementation.

Stop if the request is too broad, unsafe, destructive, or unclear.

## 4. Repo Intake

Inspect the repository before planning changes.

Required intake:

- Check `git status --short`.
- Document dirty worktree protection:
  - Existing dirty files.
  - Files planned for this workflow.
  - Overlap risk.
- Identify package manager and major languages/frameworks.
- Identify test, lint, build, and typecheck commands from package/config files.
- Identify existing architecture conventions.
- Identify likely files affected by the request.
- Note constraints, missing tooling, and unknowns.

Update `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` only with durable findings. Do not turn temporary observations into permanent rules unless they are clear from the repo.

Dirty worktree rules:

- If dirty files overlap with planned files, stop and ask before editing.
- If dirty files are unrelated, continue but document them in the spec, task plan, `_handoff/current.md`, and `_progress/progress.md`.
- Never overwrite user changes.
- Never clean or reset files unless explicitly instructed.

## 5. Spec Phase

Generate a detailed spec from the active request, the answers, and repo context.

Save the spec in `_spec/` using a timestamped or slugged filename:

```txt
_spec/2026-05-10-add-dark-theme.md
```

The spec must include:

- Request summary.
- Date.
- Source prompt.
- Questions asked and answers received.
- Assumptions.
- Goal.
- Non-goals.
- Users.
- Functional requirements.
- UI expectations, when relevant.
- API expectations, when relevant.
- Data model expectations, when relevant.
- Edge cases.
- Constraints.
- Success criteria.
- Out-of-scope items.
- Open questions.

No implementation may happen until this file exists.

## 6. Planning Phase

Before planning, read:

- `_handoff/current.md`, if it exists.
- `_progress/progress.md`.
- The latest relevant `_summary/` entry.
- The saved spec in `_spec/`.
- Relevant durable docs in `docs/`.

Generate a vertical implementation plan from the saved spec.

Save the task breakdown in `_task/` using a timestamped or slugged filename that matches the spec when practical:

```txt
_task/2026-05-10-add-dark-theme.md
```

Tasks must be vertical slices, not vague layers. A vertical task should produce a user-visible or independently verifiable result.

Each task must include:

- Task ID.
- Status.
- Objective.
- Files likely affected.
- Checklist.
- Acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance result.
- Verification commands.
- Stop condition.
- Out-of-scope items.

Each task status must follow this lifecycle:

```txt
Planned -> Ready -> In Progress -> Verified -> Reviewed -> Done
```

Allowed terminal states:

- `Done`
- `Blocked`
- `Needs Human Review`

Status rules:

- A task cannot be `Done` unless verification was attempted and the task was reviewed.
- A task cannot move to `Reviewed` unless verification was attempted.
- If verification cannot run, the task can be `Needs Human Review`, not `Done`.
- A task cannot be `Done` unless every required acceptance criterion is checked `[x]`.
- If any required acceptance result is `[ ]` or `[~]`, the task must be `Blocked` or `Needs Human Review`.

Acceptance results must use this format:

```md
Acceptance result:
- [x] Criterion met
- [ ] Criterion not met
- [~] Partially met with notes
```

Acceptance results must be copied or summarized in `_progress/progress.md`.

Use Ralph Wiggum-style task phrasing: small, literal, concrete steps with simple verbs and clear boundaries.

No implementation may happen until this file exists.

After task plan creation:

- If execution mode is `plan-only`, stop after saving the spec and task plan.
- If execution mode is `single-task`, execute only the next ready task, verify and review it, update artifacts, then stop.
- If execution mode is omitted, use `complete-workflow`.
- In `complete-workflow`, execute every task in order by default.
- Do not create the final summary until all executable tasks are completed or a stop condition is reached.

## 7. Execution Phase

Execute one task at a time, and in the default `complete-workflow` mode continue through every task in order until the full request/spec is complete or a stop condition is reached.

Each task must complete this lifecycle before the next task starts:

```txt
Planned -> Ready -> In Progress -> Verified -> Reviewed -> Done
```

For each task:

1. Read latest `_handoff/current.md`.
2. Read latest `_progress/progress.md`.
3. Read the latest relevant `_summary/` entry.
4. Read the saved spec and task plan.
5. If `_handoff/current.md` conflicts with `_progress/progress.md`, trust `_progress/progress.md` for completed task history and update handoff.
6. Inspect only the relevant codebase area.
7. Implement only the current task.
8. Run verification commands or record why they could not run.
9. If verification fails, follow the failure recovery protocol in section 8A.
10. Move the task to `Verified` when verification was attempted and results are documented.
11. Record acceptance results for every acceptance criterion.
12. Critique and review the result.
13. Move the task to `Reviewed` after review.
14. Fix only in-scope defects.
15. Re-run relevant verification if fixes were made.
16. Move the task to `Done` only after verification, review, and all required acceptance results are complete and checked `[x]`.
17. Append progress to `_progress/progress.md`, including acceptance results and failure recovery notes.
18. Update `_handoff/current.md` with the last completed task, current task, next task, blockers, dirty worktree status, acceptance status, verification status, workflow health status, and suggested next prompt.
19. Continue to the next task automatically only when the current task is `Done`.

Do not start the next task if the current task is `Blocked`, `Needs Human Review`, risky, unclear, unverified, outside scope, has unresolved in-scope defects, fails verification, or requires external access.

Stop if:

- A task is `Blocked`.
- A task is `Needs Human Review`.
- Verification fails.
- Scope becomes unclear.
- Risk increases beyond the saved spec and task plan.
- External access or credentials are needed.
- The active execution mode is explicit `single-task` and the current task has been verified, reviewed, documented, and stopped.

## 8. Verification

Verification should match the task risk.

Use available commands such as:

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

For split apps, use project-specific commands such as:

```bash
cd client && npm test
cd client && npm run build
cd server && npm test
```

If commands are missing or cannot run, document the reason in `_progress/progress.md` and the final `_summary/` entry. Provide the best manual verification available.

If verification cannot run, do not mark the task `Done`. Mark it `Needs Human Review` and stop unless the user explicitly directs a different safe path.

## 8A. Failure Recovery Protocol

When verification fails, follow this fixed recovery protocol:

1. Identify the failing command.
2. Capture the failing test or error.
3. Classify the failure as in-scope or unrelated.
4. Fix only the in-scope failure.
5. Re-run the exact failing command.
6. If fixed, continue.
7. If still failing after a reasonable targeted fix, mark the task `Needs Human Review`.
8. Update `_progress/progress.md` with the failure, fix attempt, and final result.

Failure recovery rules:

- Do not start broad refactors during failure recovery.
- Do not change unrelated code to make tests pass.
- If the failure is unrelated, document it and continue only if the active task is verified another way.
- If verification cannot prove the task, stop with `Needs Human Review`.
- Add failure recovery notes to `_progress/progress.md`, `_review/<request-id>.md`, and `_summary/<request-id>.md`.

## 9. Progress Tracking

Maintain `_progress/progress.md`.

`_progress/progress.md` is append-only task history. It records what happened over time and is authoritative for completed task history.

`_handoff/current.md` is the live resume state. It records where the workflow is now so another agent/session can continue without rereading the entire conversation.

After each task, append:

- Task ID.
- Status.
- Lifecycle transition reached.
- Files changed.
- Acceptance result.
- Verification result.
- Failure recovery notes, if any.
- Review result.
- Blockers.
- Next step.

Do not rewrite previous progress entries except to correct factual errors.

After each task, update `_handoff/current.md`. Do not leave handoff stale after task execution.

## 10. Final Diff Audit

Before final review and summary, inspect the final diff.

Required commands when available:

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Document:

- Does the diff match the saved spec?
- Were unrelated files touched?
- Were workflow artifacts updated correctly?
- Were tests added or updated for changed behavior?
- Any accidental scope creep?
- Any generated junk or temporary files?
- Any sensitive values/secrets accidentally added?

Add final diff audit results to `_review/<request-id>.md`, `_summary/<request-id>.md`, and the final response. If `git diff` cannot run, document why.

## 11. Review Phase

After implementation and before the final summary, create a review file in `_review/`.

Use a timestamped or slugged filename:

```txt
_review/2026-05-10-add-dark-theme.md
```

The review must include:

- Request.
- Spec file used.
- Task plan used.
- Tasks reviewed.
- Bugs found.
- Scope creep check.
- Final diff audit.
- Failure recovery notes.
- Missing tests.
- Security concerns.
- Architecture concerns.
- Follow-up tasks.
- Final review verdict.

If in-scope defects are found, fix them before summary and rerun relevant verification. If defects cannot be fixed safely, stop with `Needs Human Review`.

## 12. Release Notes Phase

After the review is complete and before the final summary, create release notes in `_release/`.

Use the request ID as the filename:

```txt
_release/<request-id>.md
```

Each release note must include:

- Request.
- User-facing changes.
- Developer changes.
- New routes/APIs.
- New env vars.
- Database/schema changes.
- Dependencies added/removed.
- Test commands run.
- Known limitations.
- Follow-up work.
- Suggested commit message.

If there are no user-facing changes, say so. If there are no new APIs, env vars, dependencies, or schema changes, say `none`.

## 13. Summary Phase

After the review is complete, create or append a summary in `_summary/`.

Do not create the final summary until all executable tasks are completed or a stop condition is reached.

`_summary/` is completed workflow history. It records finished workflow runs and should not replace the live resume state in `_handoff/current.md`.

The summary should include:

- Request.
- Spec file used.
- Task plan used.
- Review file used.
- Tasks completed.
- Files changed.
- Verification run.
- Acceptance results.
- Failure recovery notes.
- Final diff audit.
- Release notes file used.
- Unresolved issues.
- Next recommended work.

Use a timestamped or slugged filename when creating a new summary:

```txt
_summary/2026-05-10-add-dark-theme.md
```

After the summary is written, update `_handoff/current.md` with the summary file, workflow health status if known, unresolved issues, and the suggested next prompt.

## 14. Decision Logs

Use `_decisions/` for meaningful architecture or product decisions only. Do not create decision files for routine edits.

Each decision file must include:

- Date.
- Decision.
- Context.
- Options considered.
- Selected option.
- Consequences.
- Affected files.
- Follow-up tasks.

If no meaningful decision file was needed, report decisions as `none` in the final artifact checklist.

## 15. Critique And Fix

Before finalizing each task, review the result.

Check for:

- Scope creep.
- Broken acceptance criteria.
- Security regressions.
- Missing error states.
- Test gaps.
- Over-complex implementation.
- Inconsistent project conventions.

Fix only defects within the active task. Create follow-up tasks for anything larger.

## 16. Workflow Health Check

Before the final response, check:

- Did `WORK_REQUEST.md` sync?
- Did `_handoff/current.md` exist and reflect the latest live resume state?
- Did the spec file exist?
- Did the task plan exist?
- Was progress updated?
- Was the review created?
- Was the summary created?
- Were release notes created?
- Was the final diff audit completed or documented?
- Was the dirty worktree checked?
- Were acceptance results completed?
- Were verification commands run or documented?
- Was scope respected?
- Were decisions recorded if needed?

Final health status:

- `Passed`: all required artifacts exist, all executable tasks are complete, release notes exist, final diff audit is complete or documented, dirty worktree protection was checked, acceptance results are complete, verification was run or documented, scope was respected, and decisions were handled correctly.
- `Partial`: artifacts exist, but some tasks remain because of a documented blocker, human-review need, verification gap, or follow-up risk.
- `Failed`: any required artifact is missing, scope was not respected, or required verification/review/summary documentation is absent.

If release notes, final diff audit, dirty worktree check, or acceptance results are missing, health should be `Partial` or `Failed` depending on severity. If any required artifact is missing, mark workflow health as `Failed`.

## 17. Final Response

End with:

- Request classification.
- Spec file used.
- Task plan used.
- Tasks completed.
- Files changed.
- Verification commands and results.
- Progress update location.
- Handoff update location.
- Review location.
- Release notes location.
- Summary location.
- Decisions location or `none`.
- Workflow health status: `Passed`, `Partial`, or `Failed`.
- Final artifact checklist with exact paths:
  - Work request: `WORK_REQUEST.md`
  - Handoff: `_handoff/current.md`
  - Spec: `_spec/<file>.md`
  - Task plan: `_task/<file>.md`
  - Progress: `_progress/progress.md`
  - Review: `_review/<file>.md`
  - Release notes: `_release/<file>.md`
  - Summary: `_summary/<file>.md`
  - Decisions: `_decisions/<file>.md` or `none`
- Final diff audit result.
- Known blockers or unresolved issues.
- Recommended next step.
- Suggested commit message.

Do not claim a commit was made unless the user explicitly asked for a commit and it was actually created.
